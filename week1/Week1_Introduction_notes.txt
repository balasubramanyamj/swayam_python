what is an Algorithm:

Description how to systematically perform a task in step by step manner, simply a recipe to do something in a step by step manner

Ex: Recipe involved in preparing any dish say biryani, Steps involved in calculating sum of N numbers etc.,

To illustrate this, let us look at the steps involved in calculating the GCD of two number say gcd(m, n).

Greatest Common Divisor - GCD (The largest common divisor of both m and n)

Ex: gcd(8, 12)

Here 4 is the largest number that divides both 8 and 12 and hence the gcd(8, 12) = 4

Steps:
1. List out the factors of m
2. List out the factors of n
3. Take largest number that appears in both lists

Detailed steps:
1. Use fm, fn as list of all the possible factors for m and n respectively
2. For each i value from 1 to m, add i to fm if i divides m
3. For each j value from 1 to n, add i to fn if i divides n
4. Use cf for list of common factors
5. For each f in fm, add f to cf if f also appears in fn
6. Return largest (rightmost) value from cf
